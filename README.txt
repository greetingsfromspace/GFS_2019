A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...

...there was a web comic called "Greetings From Space". Updates were
inconsistent at the best of times, and the comic garnered little attention 
outside of the artist's small circle of friends and family. Regardless, 
the artist enjoyed the creative outlet it offered.

Attempts were made to revive the project over the years, but laziness would 
inevitably prevail, and "Greetings From Space" would time and again recede into
the background of life.

Now, in 2019, an archive is being constructed; a new home and final resting
place for an idea that was probably never worth having in the first place; 
simultaneously serving as a portfolio piece, and first foray into the world
of JQuery, for the designer.
