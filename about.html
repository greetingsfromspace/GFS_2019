                    <p>...there was a web comic called <span class="italic">"Greetings From Space"</span>. Updates were
                        inconsistent, the jokes were hit or miss, and the comic itself garnered little attention outside
                        of the
                        artist's small circle of friends and family. Regardless, the artist enjoyed the creative outlet
                        it offered
                        and carried on... until he didn't, because jokes are hard and don't write themselves.</p>
                    <p>Attempts were made to revive the project over the years, but laziness would inevitably prevail,
                        and
                        "Greetings From Space" would time and again recede into the background of life. Now, in 2019, an
                        archive has been constructed; a new home and final resting place on the web for an idea
                        that was probably never worth having in the first place.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">What does the future hold for Greetings From Space?</span> Is it finally dead?
                        No, not really. I will be posting
                        comics sporadically as I have the time and as inspiration strikes. Stay tuned!</p>
