            <p>Long before Greetings From Space was even an idea, I used to make silly flash animations for fun (some of which I might share). This program is a lot more advanced, but easy enough to pick up if you've ever used Flash. I would recommend it to any would-be animators out there.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I won't be creating an animated version of GFS any time soon. Far too time consuming for one man. That said, if FOX wants to dole out some cash, I'll put in the work... ;)</p>

                <span class="bold">Capturing a person's essense with just a few black lines is not easy.</span>
                <p>Here's a look at some rough sketches I did when trying to capture Joe Pesci for <a class="red"href="18-joe-pesci.html">The Adventures of Joe Pesci, Vol. I</a>. I got lucky with this one and found it pretty quickly, but as you can see the first few attempts were not even close.</p>
                <p>It's not that the end result has to be a true to life portrait, it just has to fool the brain enough to bring that person to mind.</p>
                <p>Stayed tuned for more behind the scenes stuff in the future!</p>
