            <p>Long before Greetings From Space was even an idea, I used to make silly flash animations for fun (some of which I might share). This program is a lot more advanced, but easy enough to pick up if you've ever used Flash. I would recommend it to any would-be animators out there.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I won't be creating an animated version of GFS any time soon. Far too time consuming for one man. That said, if FOX wants to dole out some cash, I'll put in the work... ;)</p>

                <p>Here's a look at some of the rough sketches I did while trying to nail down Joe Pesci for <a href="18-joe-pesci.html">this comic</a>.</p>
                <p>The first few attempts were way off the mark, but I think we landed somewhere in the vicinity. Or at least close enough to make it work. That's all I could really hope for.</p>
                <p>Stay tuned for more behind the scenes stuff in the future!</p>
