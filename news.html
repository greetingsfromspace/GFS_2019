            <p>Hard to believe it's been almost nine years since the original launch of this comic. Although I've neglected it over the years, I have never forgotten about it, and always planned to do something more with it. I thought it was due time to give these comics their own website again (designed and coded by yours truly!)</p>

            <p>What are my plans for this site? Well, first and foremost, to archive what I've already done in a way that does the comics justice. You'll find, for instance, my personal commentary on each and every <a href="./archive.html">archive</a> page, which give a little more insight into the thinking behind each comic.</p>

            <p>As for the future, I do intend to keep the comic alive. In fact, there's a new comic on the <a href="./index.html">front page</a> right now! I won't be keeping a regular schedule, but I will update the site whenever inspiration strikes, and hopefully that will be more often than not. Check back here or on Facebook for updates!</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://greetingsfromspace.webcomic.ws/" target="_blank">old site</a> will remain online for the time being as a backup.</p>
